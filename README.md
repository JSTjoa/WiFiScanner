# WiFiScanner
SUTD ESC Project 2021

Wifi scanning activity which will be called in mapping mode.
The mapping mode should call a getter function (to be implemented) that returns a hashmap of wifi SSID, BSSID and distance in metres to user.
This data is paired with the absolute coordinates in the mapping function and sent to a database.
